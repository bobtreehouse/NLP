longrun monetary policy implementation 
frameworks 

committee participants resumed their discussion from 
the november 2018 fomc meeting of potential longrun 
frameworks for monetary policy implementation 
at the december meeting the staff provided a set of 
briefings that considered various issues related to the 
transition to a longrun operating regime with lower levels 
of excess reserves than at present and to a longrun 
composition of the balance sheet 

the staff noted that during the transition to a longrun 
operating regime with excess reserves below current levels 
the effective federal funds rate effr could begin 
to rise a little above the interest on excess reserves 
ioer rate as reserves in the banking system declined 
gradually to a level that the committee judges to be most 
appropriate for efficient and effective implementation of 
policy this upward movement in the federal funds rate 


could be gradual however the staff noted that the federal 
funds rate and other money market rates could possibly 
become somewhat volatile at times as banks and 
financial markets adjusted to lower levels of reserve balances 
were upward pressures on the federal funds rate 
to emerge it could be challenging to distinguish between 
pressures that were transitory and likely to abate as financial 
institutions adjust and those that were more persistent 
and associated with aggregate reserve scarcity 
the staff reported on the monitoring of conditions in 
money markets as well as various survey and market outreach 
activities that could assist in detecting reserve scarcity 
the staff reviewed a number of steps that the federal 
reserve could take to ensure effective monetary policy 
implementation were upward pressures on the federal 
funds rate and other money market rates to emerge 
these steps included lowering the ioer rate further 
within the target range using the discount window to 
support the efficient distribution of reserves and slowing 
or smoothing the pace of reserve decline through 
open market operations or through slowing portfolio redemptions 
the staff also discussed new ceiling tools 
that could help keep the effr within the committee’s 
target range including options that would add new 
counterparties for the open market desk’s operations 
the staff also provided a review of the liabilities on the 
federal reserve’s balance sheet the review described the 
factors that influence the size of reserve and nonreserve 
liabilities and discussed the increase in the size of these 
liabilities since the financial crisis additionally the staff 
outlined various issues related to the longrun composition 
of the system open market account soma portfolio 
including the maturity composition of the portfolio’s 
treasury securities and the management of residual 
holdings of agency mortgagebacked securities mbs 
after the committee has normalized the size of the balance 
sheet 

in discussing the transition to a longrun operating regime 
participants commented on the advantages and 
disadvantages of allowing reserves to decline to a level 
that could put noticeable upward pressure on the federal 
funds rate at least for a time reducing reserves close 
to the lowest level that still corresponded to the flat portion 
of the reserve demand curve would be one approach 
consistent with the committee’s previously 
stated intention in the policy normalization principles 
and plans that it issued in 2014 to “hold no more securities 
than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently 
and effectively” however reducing reserves to 
a point very close to the level at which the reserve demand 
curve begins to slope upward could lead to a significant 
increase in the volatility in shortterm interest 
rates and require frequent sizable open market operations 
or new ceiling facilities to maintain effective interest 
rate control these considerations suggested that it 
might be appropriate to instead provide a buffer of reserves 
sufficient to ensure that the federal reserve operates 
consistently on the flat portion of the reserve demand 
curve so as to promote the efficient and effective 
implementation of monetary policy 

participants discussed options for maintaining control of 
interest rates should upward pressures on money market 
rates emerge during the transition to a regime with lower 
excess reserves several participants commented on options 
that rely on existing or currently used tools such 
as further technical adjustments to the ioer rate to 
keep the federal funds rate within the target range or using 
the discount window although such options were 
recognized to have limitations in some situations some 
participants commented on the possibility of slowing the 
pace of the decline in reserves in approaching the longerrun 
level of reserves standard temporary open market 
operations could be used for this purpose in addition 
participants discussed options such as ending portfolio 
redemptions with a relatively high level of reserves still 
in the system and then either maintaining that level of 
reserves or allowing growth in nonreserve liabilities to 
very gradually reduce reserves further these approaches 
could allow markets and banks more time to 
adjust to lower reserve levels while maintaining effective 
control of interest rates several participants however 
expressed concern that a slowing of redemptions could 
be misinterpreted as a signal about the stance of monetary 
policy some participants expressed an interest in 
learning more about possible options for new ceiling 
tools to provide firmer control of the policy rate 

participants commented on the role that the federal reserve’s 
nonreserve liabilities have played in the expansion 
of the federal reserve’s balance sheet since the financial 
crisis many participants noted that the magnitudes 
of these nonreserve liabilities—most significantly 
currency but also liabilities to the treasury through the 
treasury general account and liabilities to foreign official 
institutions through their accounts at the federal reserve—
are not closely related to federal reserve monetary 
policy decisions they also remarked that the size 
of the federal reserve’s balance sheet was expected to 
increase over time as the growth of these liabilities 
roughly tracks the growth of nominal gross domestic 
product gdp additionally participants cited the social 
benefits provided by these liabilities to the economy 


participants considered it important to present information 
on the federal reserve’s balance sheet to the 
public in ways that communicated these facts in discussing 
the longrun level of reserve liabilities participants 
noted that it might be useful to explore ways to 
encourage banks to reduce their demand for reserves 
and to provide information to banks and the public 
about the likely longrun level of reserves 

participants commented on a number of issues related 
to the longrun composition of the soma portfolio 
with regard to the portfolio of treasury securities participants 
discussed the advantages of different portfolio 
maturity compositions several participants noted that a 
portfolio of holdings weighted toward shorter maturities 
would provide greater flexibility to lengthen maturity if 
warranted by an economic downturn while a couple of 
others noted that a portfolio with maturities that 
matched the outstanding treasury market would have a 
more neutral effect on the market with regard to the 
mbs portfolio participants noted that the passive runoff 
of mbs holdings through principal paydowns would 
continue for many years after the size of the balance 
sheet had been normalized several participants commented 
on the possibility of reducing agency mbs holdings 
somewhat more quickly than the passive approach 
by implementing a program of very gradual mbs sales 
sometime after the size of the balance sheet had been 
normalized 

participants expected to continue their discussion of 
longrun implementation frameworks and related issues 
at upcoming meetings they reiterated the importance 
of communicating clearly on the rationale for any decision 
made on the implementation framework 

developments in financial markets and open market 
operations 

the soma manager reviewed developments in financial 
markets over the intermeeting period asset prices were 
volatile in recent weeks reportedly reflecting a pullback 
from risktaking by investors in part the deterioration 
in risk sentiment appeared to stem importantly from uncertainty 
about the state of trade negotiations between 
china and the united states in addition investors 
pointed to concerns about the global growth outlook 
the unsettled state of brexit negotiations and uncertainties 
about the political situation in europe 

against this backdrop us stock prices were down 
nearly 8 percent on the period risk spreads on corporate 
bonds widened appreciably with market participants 
reportedly focusing on the potential implications 
of downside risks to the us economic outlook for the 
financial condition of companies particularly for companies 
at the lower end of the investmentgrade spectrum 
treasury yields declined significantly especially at 
longer maturities contributing to some flattening of the 
treasury yield curve based on readings from treasury 
inflationprotected securities tips the decline in 
nominal treasury yields was associated with a notable 
drop in inflation compensation a sizable decline in oil 
prices was cited as an important factor contributing to 
the drop in measures of inflation compensation 

the deterioration in market sentiment was accompanied 
by a significant downward revision in the expected path 
of the federal funds rate based on federal funds futures 
quotes in addition futuresbased measures of policy 
expectations moved lower in response to speeches by 
federal reserve officials the revision in the expected 
policy path was less noticeable in the desk’s surveybased 
measures of the expected path of the federal funds 
rate desk surveys indicated that respondents placed 
high odds on a further quarterpoint firming in the 
stance of monetary policy at the december meeting but 
lower than the near certainty of a rate increase reported 
just before previous policy firmings in 2018 survey responses 
anticipated that the median projected path of 
the federal funds rate in the summary of economic projections 
sep would show only two additional quarterpoint 
policy firmings next year—down from the three 
policy firmings in the median path in the september sep 
results 

the deputy manager followed with a discussion of 
money market developments and open market operations 
after a fast narrowing of the spread between the 
ioer rate and the effr before the november meeting 
the effr had remained stable at or just 1 basis 
point below the level of the ioer rate since then some 
upward pressures on overnight rates were evident in the 
repurchase agreement repo market apparently from 
higher issuance of treasury bills and an associated expansion 
of primary dealer inventories over the intermeeting 
period banks expanded their lending in repo 
markets in light of higher repo rates relative to the ioer 
rate the willingness of banks to lend in repo markets 
suggested that the reserve supply was still ample the 
deputy manager noted the results of the recent desk surveys 
of primary dealers and market participants indicating 
an increase in the median respondent’s estimate of 
the longrun level of reserve balances to a level closer to 
that implied by banks’ responses in the senior financial 
officer survey conducted in advance of the november 
fomc meeting the deputy manager also reported on 
paydowns on the soma securities holdings under the 


baseline outlook prepayments of principal on agency 
mbs would remain below the 20 billion redemption 
cap for the foreseeable future however if longerterm 
interest rates moved substantively lower than assumed 
in the baseline some modest reinvestments in mbs 
could occur for a few months next year concurrent with 
the pickup in seasonal turnover 

by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period 
there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies 
for the system’s account during the intermeeting period 


staff review of the economic situation 

the information reviewed for the december 18–19 
meeting indicated that labor market conditions continued 
to strengthen in recent months and that real gdp 
growth was strong consumer price inflation as measured 
by the 12month percentage change in the price index 
for personal consumption expenditures pce was 
2 percent in october surveybased measures of longerrun 
inflation expectations were little changed on balance 

total nonfarm payroll employment expanded further in 
november and job gains were strong on average over 
recent months the national unemployment rate remained 
at a very low level of 37 percent and both the 
labor force participation rate and the employmenttopopulation 
ratio also stayed flat in november the unemployment 
rates for african americans asians and 
hispanics in november were below their levels at the 
end of the previous economic expansion the share of 
workers employed part time for economic reasons was 
still close to the lows reached in late 2007 the rates of 
privatesector job openings and quits were both still at 
high levels in october initial claims for unemployment 
insurance benefits in early december were still close to 
historically low levels total labor compensation per 
hour in the nonfarm business sector—a volatile measure 
even on a fourquarter change basis—increased 22 percent 
over the four quarters ending in the third quarter 
average hourly earnings for all employees rose 31 percent 
over the 12 months ending in november 

industrial production expanded on net over october 
and november output increased in the mining and utilities 
sectors while manufacturing production edged 
down on balance automakers’ assembly schedules suggested 
that production of light motor vehicles would rise 
in december and new orders indexes from national and 
regional manufacturing surveys pointed to moderate 
gains in total factory output in the coming months 

household spending continued to increase at a strong 
pace in recent months real pce growth was brisk in 
october and the components of the nominal retail sales 
used by the bureau of economic analysis to construct 
its estimate of pce rose considerably in november 
the pace of light motor vehicle sales edged down in november 
but stayed near its recent elevated level key 
factors that influence consumer spending—including 
ongoing gains in real disposable personal income and the 
effects of earlier increases in equity prices and home values 
on households’ net worth—continued to be supportive 
of solid real pce growth in the near term consumer 
sentiment as measured by the university of 
michigan surveys of consumers remained relatively upbeat 
through early december 

real residential investment appeared to be declining further 
in the fourth quarter likely reflecting in part the effects 
of the rise in mortgage interest rates over the past 
year on the affordability of housing starts of new single
family homes decreased in october and november 
although starts of multifamily units rose sharply in november 
building permit issuance for new singlefamily 
homes which tends to be a good indicator of the underlying 
trend in construction of such homes moved down 
modestly over recent months sales of new homes declined 
markedly in october although existing home 
sales increased modestly 

growth in real private expenditures for business equipment 
and intellectual property looked to be picking up 
solidly in the fourth quarter after moderating in the previous 
quarter nominal shipments of nondefense capital 
goods excluding aircraft moved up in october 
forwardlooking indicators of business equipment 
spending—such as a rising backlog of unfilled orders for 
nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft and upbeat 
readings on business sentiment—pointed to further 
spending gains in the near term nominal business expenditures 
for nonresidential structures outside of the 
drilling and mining sector declined modestly in october 
while the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation—
an indicator of business spending for structures 
in the drilling and mining sector—held about 
steady in november through early december 

total real government purchases appeared to be rising 
moderately in the fourth quarter nominal defense 
spending in october and november pointed to solid 
growth in real federal purchases real purchases by state 
and local governments looked to be only edging up as 
nominal construction spending by these governments 


rose solidly in october but their payrolls declined a little 
in october and november 

the nominal us international trade deficit widened 
slightly in october exports declined a little with decreases 
in exports of agricultural products and capital 
goods although exports of industrial supplies increased 
imports rose a bit with increases in imports of consumer 
goods and automotive products but imports of 
capital goods declined sharply from september’s elevated 
level available trade data suggested that the contribution 
of the change in net exports to the rate of real 
gdp growth in the fourth quarter would be much less 
negative than the drag of nearly 2 percentage points in 
the third quarter 

total us consumer prices as measured by the pce 
price index increased 2 percent over the 12 months ending 
in october core pce price inflation which excludes 
changes in consumer food and energy prices was 
18 percent over that same period the consumer price 
index cpi rose 22 percent over the 12 months ending 
in november and core cpi inflation was also 22 percent 
recent readings on surveybased measures of 
longerrun inflation expectations—including those from 
the michigan survey the survey of professional forecasters 
and the desk’s survey of primary dealers and 
survey of market participants—were little changed on 
balance 

foreign economic growth continued at a moderate pace 
in the third quarter as a pickup in emerging market 
economies emes roughly offset slowing growth in advanced 
foreign economies afes among emes 
growth in mexico and brazil bounced back from transitory 
secondquarter weakness more than offsetting a 
slowdown in china and india the softness in afe 
growth partly reflected temporary factors including disruptions 
from natural disasters in japan and the adoption 
of new car emissions testing in germany indicators 
for economic activity in the fourth quarter were 
consistent with continued moderate foreign economic 
growth foreign inflation fell in recent months largely 
reflecting a significant drag from lower oil prices underlying 
inflation pressures especially in some afes remained 
muted 

staff review of the financial situation 

investors’ perceptions of downside risks to the domestic 
and global outlook appeared to increase over the intermeeting 
period reportedly driven in part by signs of 
slowing in foreign economies and growing concerns 
over escalating trade frictions both nominal us treasury 
yields and us equity prices declined notably over 
the period financing conditions for businesses and 
households tightened a bit but generally remained supportive 
of economic growth 

remarks by federal reserve officials over the intermeeting 
period were interpreted by market participants as signaling 
a shift in the stance of policy toward a more gradual 
path of federal funds rate increases the marketimplied 
path for the federal funds rate for 2019 and 2020 
shifted down markedly while the marketimplied probability 
for a rate hike at the december fomc meeting 
declined slightly though remained high 

nominal treasury yields fell considerably over the period 
with the declines most pronounced in longerdated 
maturities and contributing to a flattening of the yield 
curve the spread between 10 and 2year nominal 
treasury yields narrowed to near the 20th percentile of 
its distribution since 1971 investor perceptions of increased 
downside risks to the outlooks for domestic and 
foreign economic growth including growing concerns 
over trade frictions between the united states and 
china reportedly weighed on yields measures of inflation 
compensation derived from tips also decreased 
notably over the period along with the declines in oil 
prices 

concerns over escalating trade tensions global growth 
prospects and the sustainability of corporate earnings 
growth were among the factors that appeared to contribute 
to a significant drop in us equity prices the declines 
were largest in the technology and retail sectors 
onemonth optionimplied volatility on the sp 500 index—
the vix—increased over the period and corporate 
credit spreads widened consistent with the selloff in 
equities 

over the intermeeting period foreign financial markets 
were affected by perceived increases in downside risks 
to the global growth outlook and ongoing uncertainty 
about trade relations between the united states and 
china investors also focused on the state of negotiations 
over brexit and the italian government budget deficit 
equity markets in afes posted notable declines 
and europededicated bond and equity funds reported 
strong outflows equity declines in emes were more 
modest and emerging market funds received modest inflows 
on net 

afe sovereign yields declined significantly reflecting 
decreases in us bond yields and weakerthanexpected 
euroarea and uk economic data measures of inflation 
compensation generally fell partly reflecting sharp 
decreases in oil prices spreads of italian sovereign 


yields over german counterparts narrowed amid progress 
on budget negotiations between the italian government 
and the european commission the us dollar 
appreciated modestly although declines in us yields 
weighed on the dollar deteriorating global risk sentiment 
provided support ongoing uncertainty about the 
passage of a brexit withdrawal agreement put downward 
pressure on the exchange value of the british pound 

shortterm funding markets functioned smoothly over 
the intermeeting period elevated levels of treasury bills 
outstanding have continued to put upward pressure on 
money market rates the effr held steady at or very 
close to the level of the ioer rate while takeup in the 
overnight reverse repo facility remained near historically 
low levels in offshore funding markets the onemonth 
foreign exchange swap basis for most major currencies 
increased consistent with typical yearend pressures 

financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained 
accommodative on net though funding conditions for 
capital markets tightened somewhat as spreads on nonfinancial 
corporate bonds widened to near the middle of 
their historical distribution gross issuance of corporate 
bonds also moderated in november driven by a significant 
stepdown in speculativegrade bond issuance 
while institutional leveraged loan issuance also slowed in 
november small business credit market conditions 
were little changed and credit conditions in municipal 
bond markets stayed accommodative on net 

privatesector analysts revised down their projections 
for yearahead corporate earnings a bit in many cases 
nonfinancial firms’ earnings reports suggested that tariffs 
were a salient concern in the changed outlook for 
corporate earnings the pace of gross equity issuance 
through both seasoned and initial offerings moderated 
consistent with the weakness and volatility in the stock 
market 

in the commercial real estate cre sector financing 
conditions remained accommodative commercial 
mortgagebacked securities cmbs spreads widened 
slightly over the intermeeting period but remained near 
postcrisis lows issuance of nonagency cmbs was stable 
while cre loan growth remained strong at banks 
financing conditions in the residential mortgage market 
also remained accommodative for most borrowers but 
the demand for mortgage credit softened purchase 
mortgage origination activity declined modestly while 
refinance activity remained muted 

financing conditions in consumer credit markets also remained 
accommodative broad consumer credit grew at 
a solid pace through september though october and 
november saw credit card growth at banks edge a bit 
lower on average conditions in the consumer assetbacked 
securities market remained stable over the intermeeting 
period with slightly higher spreads and robust 
issuance 

staff economic outlook 

with some strongerthanexpected incoming data on 
economic activity and the recent tightening in financial 
conditions particularly the decline in equity prices the 
us economic forecast prepared by the staff for the december 
fomc meeting was little revised on balance 
the staff continued to expect that real gdp growth 
would be strong in the fourth quarter of 2018 although 
somewhat slower than the rapid pace of growth in the 
previous two quarters over the 2018–20 period real 
gdp was forecast to rise at a rate above the staff’s estimate 
of potential output growth and then slow to a pace 
below it in 2021 the unemployment rate was projected 
to decline further below the staff’s estimate of its longerrun 
natural rate but to bottom out by 2020 and begin to 
edge up in 2021 with labor market conditions already 
tight the staff continued to assume that projected employment 
gains would manifest in smallerthanusual 
downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in 
largerthanusual upward pressure on the labor force 
participation rate 

the staff expected both total and core pce price inflation 
to be just a touch below 2 percent in 2018 with total 
inflation revised down a bit because of recent declines in 
consumer energy prices core pce price inflation was 
forecast to move up to 2 percent in 2019 and remain at 
that level through the medium term total inflation was 
forecast to be a little below core inflation in 2019 reflecting 
projected declines in energy prices and then to 
run at the same level as core inflation over the following 
two years the staff’s mediumterm projections for both 
total and core pce price inflation were little revised on 
net 

the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections 
for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation 
as similar to the average of the past 20 years the 
staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp 
growth and the unemployment rate as balanced on the 
upside household spending and business investment 
could expand faster than the staff projected supported 
in part by the tax cuts enacted last year on the downside 
trade policies and foreign economic developments 
could move in directions that have significant negative 
effects on us economic growth risks to the inflation 


projection also were seen as balanced the upside risk 
that inflation could increase more than expected in an 
economy that was projected to move further above its 
potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that 
longerterm inflation expectations may be lower than 
was assumed in the staff forecast 

participants’ views on current conditions and the 
economic outlook 

in conjunction with this fomc meeting members of 
the board of governors and federal reserve bank presidents 
submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes 
for real gdp growth the unemployment rate 
and inflation for each year from 2018 through 2021 and 
over the longer run based on their individual assessments 
of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate 
the longerrun projections represented each participant’s 
assessment of the rate to which each variable 
would be expected to converge over time under appropriate 
monetary policy and in the absence of further 
shocks to the economy these projections and policy 
assessments are described in the sep which is an addendum 
to these minutes 

in their discussion of the economic situation and the 
outlook meeting participants agreed that information 
received since the fomc met in november indicated 
that the labor market had continued to strengthen and 
that economic activity had been rising at a strong rate 
job gains had been strong on average in recent months 
and the unemployment rate had remained low household 
spending had continued to grow strongly while 
growth of business fixed investment had moderated 
from its rapid pace earlier in the year on a 12month 
basis both overall inflation and inflation for items other 
than food and energy remained near 2 percent indicators 
of longerterm inflation expectations were little 
changed on balance 

in assessing the economic outlook participants noted 
the contrast between the strength of incoming data on 
economic activity and the concerns about downside 
risks evident in financial markets and in reports from 
business contacts recent readings on household and 
business spending inflation and labor market conditions 
were largely in line with participants’ expectations 
and indicated continued strength of the economy by 
contrast financial markets were volatile and conditions 
had tightened over the intermeeting period with sizable 
declines in equity prices and notably wider corporate 
credit spreads coinciding with a continued flattening of 
the treasury yield curve in part these changes in financial 
conditions appeared to reflect greater concerns 
about the global economic outlook participants also reported 
hearing more frequent concerns about the global 
economic outlook from business contacts 

after taking into account incoming economic data information 
from business contacts and the tightening of 
financial conditions participants generally revised down 
their individual assessments of the appropriate path for 
monetary policy and indicated either no material change 
or only a modest downward revision in their assessment 
of the economic outlook economic growth was expected 
to remain above trend in 2019 and then slow to 
a pace closer to trend over the medium term participants 
who downgraded their assessment of the economic 
outlook pointed to a variety of factors underlying 
their assessment including recent financial market developments 
some softening in the foreign economic 
growth outlook or a more pessimistic outlook for 
housingsector activity 

in their discussion of the household sector participants 
generally characterized real pce growth as remaining 
strong participants pointed to a number of factors that 
were supporting consumer spending including further 
gains in wages and household income reflecting a strong 
labor market expansionary federal tax policies stillupbeat 
readings on consumer sentiment recent declines 
in oil prices and household balance sheets that generally 
remained healthy despite tighter financial conditions 
although household spending overall was seen as 
strong several participants noted continued weakness in 
residential investment this weakness was attributed to 
a variety of factors including increased mortgage rates 
and rising home prices reports from district contacts 
in the auto sector were mixed 

several participants noted that business fixed investment 
remained solid despite a slowdown in the third quarter 
as more recent data pointed to a rebound in investment 
spending business contacts in several districts reported 
robust activity through the end of 2018 and planned to 
follow through or expand on their current capital expenditure 
projects however contacts in a number of 
districts appeared less upbeat than at the time of the 
november meeting as concerns about a variety of factors—
including trade policy waning fiscal stimulus 
slowing global economic growth or financial market 
volatility—were reportedly beginning to weigh on business 
sentiment a couple of participants commented 
that the recent decline in oil prices could be a sign of a 
weakening in global demand that could weigh on capital 
spending by oil production companies and affect companies 
providing services to the oil industry however 


a couple of participants noted that the recent oil price 
decline could also be associated with increasing oil supply 
rather than softening global demand 

contacts in the agricultural sector reported that conditions 
remained depressed in part because of the effects 
of trade policy actions on exports and farm incomes uncertainty 
about future trade agreements and continued 
low commodity prices banks continued to report a 
gradual increase in agricultural loan delinquencies in recent 
months nonetheless participants cited a few recent 
favorable developments including new trade mitigation 
payments as well as legislative action to maintain 
crop insurance that was seen as reducing uncertainty 

participants agreed that labor market conditions had remained 
strong payrolls continued to grow at an abovetrend 
rate in november and measures of labor market 
tightness such as rates of job openings and quits continued 
to be elevated the unemployment rate remained at 
a historically low level in november and the labor force 
participation rate stayed steady which represented an 
improvement relative to its gradual downwardsloping 
underlying trend several participants observed that labor 
force participation had been improving for lowskilled 
workers and for primeage workers a couple of 
participants saw scope for further improvements in the 
labor force participation rate relative to its historical 
downward trend while a couple of others judged that 
there was little scope for significant further improvements 


contacts in many districts continued to report tight labor 
markets with difficulties finding qualified workers 
in some cases firms were responding to these difficulties 
by using various types of nonwage incentives to attract 
and retain workers while in other cases firms were 
responding by raising wages many participants observed 
that at the national level most measures of nominal 
wage growth had risen and were currently at levels 
that were broadly in line with trends in productivity 
growth and inflation 

participants observed that both overall and core pce 
price inflation remained near 2 percent on a 12month 
basis but that core inflation had edged lower in recent 
months a few participants noted that the recent declines 
in energy prices would likely only temporarily 
weigh on headline inflation several participants remarked 
that longerterm tipsbased inflation compensation 
had declined notably since november concurrent 
with both falling oil prices and a deterioration in investor 
risk sentiment a few participants pointed to the decline 
in longerterm inflation compensation as an indication 
that longerrun inflation expectations may have edged 
lower while several others cited surveybased measures 
as suggesting that longerrun expectations likely remained 
anchored participants generally continued to 
view recent price developments as consistent with their 
expectation that inflation would remain near the committee’s 
symmetric 2 percent objective on a sustained 
basis although a few participants pointed to anecdotal 
and survey evidence indicating rising input costs and 
passthrough of these higher costs to consumer prices 
reports from business contacts and surveys in some 
other districts suggested some moderation in inflationary 
pressure 

in their discussion of financial developments participants 
agreed that financial markets had been volatile and 
financial conditions had tightened over the intermeeting 
period as equity prices declined corporate credit 
spreads widened and the treasury yield curve continued 
to flatten some participants commented that these developments 
may reflect an increased focus among market 
participants on tail risks such as a sharp escalation of 
trade tensions or could be a signal of a significant slowdown 
in the pace of economic growth in the future a 
couple of participants noted that the tightening in financial 
conditions so far did not appear to be restraining real 
activity although a more persistent tightening would undoubtedly 
weigh on business and household spending 
participants agreed to continue to monitor financial 
market developments and assess the implications of 
these developments for the economic outlook 

participants commented on a number of risks associated 
with their outlook for economic activity the labor market 
and inflation over the medium term various factors 
that could pose downside risks for domestic economic 
growth and inflation were mentioned including the possibilities 
of a sharperthanexpected slowdown in global 
economic growth a more rapid waning of fiscal stimulus 
an escalation in trade tensions a further tightening 
of financial conditions or greaterthananticipated negative 
effects from the monetary policy tightening to date 
a few participants expressed concern that longerrun inflation 
expectations would remain low particularly if 
economic growth slowed more than expected with regard 
to upside risks participants noted that the effects 
of fiscal stimulus could turn out to be greater than expected 
and the uncertainties surrounding trade tensions 
or the global growth outlook could be resolved favorably 
leading to strongerthanexpected economic outcomes 
while a couple of participants suggested that 
tightening resource utilization in conjunction with an increase 
in the ability of firms to pass through increases in 


input costs to consumer prices could generate undesirable 
upward pressure on inflation a couple of participants 
pointed to risks to financial stability stemming 
from high levels of corporate borrowing especially by 
riskier firms and elevated cre prices in general participants 
agreed that risks to the outlook appeared 
roughly balanced although some noted that downside 
risks may have increased of late 

in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting 
participants generally judged that the economy was 
evolving about as anticipated with real economic activity 
rising at a strong rate labor market conditions continuing 
to strengthen and inflation near the committee’s 
objective based on their current assessments most participants 
expressed the view that it would be appropriate 
for the committee to raise the target range for the federal 
funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting a few 
participants however favored no change in the target 
range at this meeting judging that the absence of signs 
of upward inflation pressure afforded the committee 
some latitude to wait and see how the data would develop 
amid the recent rise in financial market volatility 
and increased uncertainty about the global economic 
growth outlook 

with regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond 
this meeting participants generally judged that some further 
gradual increases in the target range for the federal 
funds rate would most likely be consistent with a sustained 
economic expansion strong labor market conditions 
and inflation near 2 percent over the medium 
term with an increase in the target range at this meeting 
the federal funds rate would be at or close to the 
lower end of the range of estimates of the longerrun 
neutral interest rate and participants expressed that recent 
developments including the volatility in financial 
markets and the increased concerns about global growth 
made the appropriate extent and timing of future policy 
firming less clear than earlier against this backdrop 
many participants expressed the view that especially in 
an environment of muted inflation pressures the committee 
could afford to be patient about further policy 
firming a number of participants noted that before 
making further changes to the stance of policy it was 
important for the committee to assess factors such as 
how the risks that had become more pronounced in recent 
months might unfold and to what extent they would 
affect economic activity and the effects of past actions 
to remove policy accommodation which were likely still 
working their way through the economy 

participants emphasized that the committee’s approach 
to setting the stance of policy should be importantly 
guided by the implications of incoming data for the economic 
outlook they noted that their expectations for 
the path of the federal funds rate were based on their 
current assessment of the economic outlook monetary 
policy was not on a preset course neither the pace nor 
the ultimate endpoint of future rate increases was 
known if incoming information prompted meaningful 
reassessments of the economic outlook and attendant 
risks either to the upside or the downside their policy 
outlook would change various factors such as the recent 
tightening in financial conditions and risks to the 
global outlook on the one hand and further indicators 
of tightness in labor markets and possible risks to financial 
stability from a prolonged period of tight resource 
utilization on the other hand were noted in this context 

participants discussed ideas for effectively communicating 
to the public the committee’s datadependent approach 
including options for transitioning away from 
forward guidance language in future postmeeting statements 
several participants expressed the view that it 
might be appropriate over upcoming meetings to remove 
forward guidance entirely and replace it with language 
emphasizing the datadependent nature of policy 
decisions 

participants supported a plan to implement another 
technical adjustment to the ioer rate that would place 
it 10 basis points below the top of the target range for 
the federal funds rate this adjustment would foster 
trading in the federal funds market at rates well within 
the fomc’s target range 

committee policy action 

in their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead members judged that information received since 
the committee met in november indicated that the labor 
market had continued to strengthen and that economic 
activity had been rising at a strong rate job gains 
had been strong on average in recent months and the 
unemployment rate had remained low household 
spending had continued to grow strongly while growth 
of business fixed investment had moderated from its 
rapid pace earlier in the year on a 12month basis both 
overall inflation and inflation for items other than food 
and energy remained near 2 percent indicators of 
longerterm inflation expectations were little changed 
on balance 

members generally judged that the economy had been 
evolving about as they had anticipated at the previous 
meeting though financial conditions had tightened and 


global growth had moderated members generally anticipated 
that growth would remain above trend and the 
labor market would remain strong members judged 
that some further gradual increases in the target range 
for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained 
expansion of economic activity strong labor market 
conditions and inflation near the committee’s symmetric 
2 percent objective over the medium term 

after assessing current conditions and the outlook for 
economic activity the labor market and inflation members 
decided to raise the target range for the federal 
funds rate to 2¼ to 2½ percent members agreed that 
the timing and size of future adjustments to the target 
range for the federal funds rate would depend on their 
assessment of realized and expected economic conditions 
relative to the committee’s maximum employment 
and symmetric 2 percent inflation objectives they reiterated 
that this assessment would take into account a 
wide range of information including measures of labor 
market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and 
inflation expectations and readings on financial and international 
developments more generally members 
noted that decisions regarding nearterm adjustments of 
the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain 
dependent on the evolution of the outlook as informed 
by incoming data 

with regard to the postmeeting statement members 
agreed to modify the phrase “the committee expects 
that further gradual increases” to read “the committee 
judges that some further gradual increases” the use of 
the word “judges” in the revised phrase was intended to 
better convey the datadependency of the committee’s 
decisions regarding the future stance of policy the reference 
to “some” further gradual increases was viewed 
as helping indicate that based on current information 
the committee judged that a relatively limited amount of 
additional tightening likely would be appropriate while 
members judged that the risks to the economic outlook 
were roughly balanced they decided that recent developments 
warranted emphasizing that the committee 
would “continue to monitor global economic and financial 
developments and assess their implications for the 
economic outlook” 

at the conclusion of the discussion the committee 
voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank 
of new york until instructed otherwise to execute 
transactions in the soma in accordance with the following 
domestic policy directive to be released at 
200 pm 

“effective december 20 2018 the federal 
open market committee directs the desk to 
undertake open market operations as necessary 
to maintain the federal funds rate in a target 
range of 2¼ to 2½ percent including overnight 
reverse repurchase operations and reverse repurchase 
operations with maturities of more 
than one day when necessary to accommodate 
weekend holiday or similar trading conventions 
at an offering rate of 225 percent in 
amounts limited only by the value of treasury 
securities held outright in the system open 
market account that are available for such operations 
and by a percounterparty limit of 
30 billion per day 

the committee directs the desk to continue 
rolling over at auction the amount of principal 
payments from the federal reserve’s holdings 
of treasury securities maturing during each calendar 
month that exceeds 30 billion and to 
continue reinvesting in agency mortgagebacked 
securities the amount of principal payments 
from the federal reserve’s holdings of 
agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities 
received during each calendar month that 
exceeds 20 billion small deviations from 
these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable 


the committee also directs the desk to engage 
in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as 
necessary to facilitate settlement of the federal 
reserve’s agency mortgagebacked securities 
transactions” 

the vote also encompassed approval of the statement 
below to be released at 200 pm 

“information received since the federal open

summary of economic projections 

 

in conjunction with the federal open market committee 
fomc meeting held on december 18–19 2018 
meeting participants submitted their projections of the 
most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product 
gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation for 
each year from 2018 to 2021 and over the longer run1 
each participant’s projections were based on information 
available at the time of the meeting together with 
his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy— 
including a path for the federal funds rate and its longerrun 
value—and assumptions about other factors likely 
to affect economic outcomes the longerrun projections 
represent each participant’s assessment of the 
value to which each variable would be expected to converge 
over time under appropriate monetary policy and 
in the absence of further shocks to the economy2 “appropriate 
monetary policy” is defined as the future path 
of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster 
outcomes for economic activity and inflation that 
best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the 
statutory mandate to promote maximum employment 
and price stability 

1 five members of the board of governors one more than in 
september 2018 were in office at the time of the december 
2018 meeting and submitted economic projections 

2 one participant did not submit longerrun projections for 
real gdp growth the unemployment rate or the federal funds 
rate 

all participants who submitted longerrun projections 
expected that under appropriate monetary policy 
growth in real gdp in 2019 would run somewhat above 
their individual estimate of its longerrun rate most participants 
continued to expect real gdp growth to slow 
throughout the projection horizon with a majority of 
participants projecting growth in 2021 to be a little below 
their estimate of its longerrun rate almost all participants 
who submitted longerrun projections continued 
to expect that the unemployment rate would run below 
their estimate of its longerrun level through 2021 
most participants projected that inflation as measured 
by the fourquarter percentage change in the price index 
for personal consumption expenditures pce would 
increase slightly over the next two years and nearly all 
participants expected that it would be at or slightly above 
the committee’s 2 percent objective in 2020 and 2021 
compared with the summary of economic projections 
sep from september many participants marked down 
slightly their projections for real gdp growth and inflation 
in 2019 table 1 and figure 1 provide summary statistics 
for the projections 

as shown in figure 2 participants generally continued to 
expect that the evolution of the economy relative to 
their objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent 
inflation would likely warrant some further gradual increases 
in the federal funds rate compared with the 
september submissions the median projections for the 
federal funds rate for the end of 2019 through 2021 and 
over the longer run were a little lower most participants 
expected that the federal funds rate at the end of 2020 
and 2021 would be modestly higher than their estimate 
of its level over the longer run however many marked 
down the extent to which it would exceed their estimate 
of the longerrun level relative to their september projections 


on balance participants continued to view the uncertainty 
around their projections as broadly similar to the 
average of the past 20 years while most participants 
viewed the risks to the outlook as balanced a couple 
more participants than in september saw risks to real 
gdp growth as weighted to the downside and one less 
participant viewed the risks to inflation as weighted to 
the upside 

the outlook for economic activity 

the median of participants’ projections for the growth 
rate of real gdp for 2019 conditional on their individual 
assessment of appropriate monetary policy was 
23 percent slower than the 30 percent pace expected 
for 2018 most participants continued to expect gdp 
growth to slow throughout the projection horizon with 
the median projection at 20 percent in 2020 and at 
18 percent in 2021 a touch lower than the median estimate 
of its longerrun rate of 19 percent relative to the 
september sep the medians of the projections for real 
gdp growth for 2018 and 2019 were slightly lower 
while the median for the longerrun rate of growth was 
a bit higher several participants mentioned tighter financial 
conditions or a softer global economic outlook 
as factors behind the downward revisions to their nearterm 
growth estimates 

the median of projections for the unemployment rate in 
the fourth quarter of 2019 was 35 percent unchanged 
from the september sep and almost 1 percentage point 
below the median assessment of its longerrun normal 
level with participants generally continuing to expect 


the unemployment rate to bottom out in 2019 or 2020 
the median projections for 2020 and 2021 edged back up 
to 36 percent and 38 percent respectively nevertheless 
most participants continued to project that the unemployment 
rate in 2021 would still be well below their 
estimates of its longerrun level the median estimate of 
the longerrun normal rate of unemployment was 
slightly lower than in september 

figures 3a and 3b show the distributions of participants’ 
projections for real gdp growth and the unemployment 
rate from 2018 to 2021 and in the longer run 
the distributions of individual projections for real gdp 
growth for 2019 and 2020 shifted down relative to those 
in the september sep while the distributions for 2021 
and for the longerrun rate of gdp growth were little 
changed the distribution of individual projections for 
the unemployment rate in 2019 was a touch more dispersed 
relative to the distribution of the september projections 
the distribution moved slightly higher for 2020 
while the distribution for the longerrun normal rate 
shifted toward the lower end of its range 

the outlook for inflation 

the median of projections for total pce price inflation 
was 19 percent in 2019 a bit lower than in the september 
sep while the medians for 2020 and 2021 were 
21 percent the same as in the previous projections the 
medians of projections for core pce price inflation over 
the 2019–21 period were 20 percent a touch lower than 
in september some participants pointed to softer incoming 
data or recent declines in oil prices as reasons 
for shaving their projections for inflation 

figures 3c and 3d provide information on the distributions 
of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation 
on the whole the distributions of projections 
for total pce price inflation and core pce price inflation 
beyond this year either shifted slightly to the left or 
were unchanged relative to the september sep most 
participants revised down slightly their projections of total 
pce price inflation for 2019 all participants expected 
that total pce price inflation would be in a range 
from 20 to 23 percent in 2020 and 2021 most participants 
projected that core pce inflation would run at 
20 to 21 percent throughout the projection horizon 

appropriate monetary policy 

figure 3e shows distributions of participants’ judgments 
regarding the appropriate target—or midpoint of 
the target range—for the federal funds rate at the end of 
each year from 2018 to 2021 and over the longer run 
the distributions for 2019 through 2021 were less dispersed 
and shifted slightly toward lower values compared 
with the projections prepared for the september 
sep the median federal funds rate was 25 basis points 
lower over the 2019–21 period for the end of 2019 the 
median of federal funds rate projections was 288 percent 
consistent with two 25 basis point rate increases 
over the course of 2019 thereafter the medians of the 
projections were 313 percent at the end of 2020 and 
2021 most participants expected that the federal funds 
rate at the end of 2020 and 2021 would be modestly 
higher than their estimate of its level over the longer run 
however many marked down the extent to which it 
would exceed their estimate of the longerrun level relative 
to their september projections the median of the 
longerrun projections of the federal funds rate was 
275 percent 25 basis points lower than in september 

in discussing their projections many participants continued 
to express the view that any further increases in 
the federal funds rate over the next few years would 
likely be gradual that anticipated pace reflected a few 
factors such as a shortterm neutral real interest rate that 
is currently low and an inflation rate that has been rising 
only gradually to the committee’s 2 percent objective 
some participants cited a weaker nearterm trajectory for 
economic growth or a muted response of inflation to 
tight labor market conditions as factors contributing to 
the downward revisions in their assessments of the appropriate 
path for the policy rate 

uncertainty and risks 

in assessing the appropriate path of the federal funds 
rate fomc participants take account of the range of 
possible economic outcomes the likelihood of those 
outcomes and the potential benefits and costs should 
they occur as a reference table 2 provides measures of 
forecast uncertainty—based on the forecast errors of 
various private and government forecasts over the past 
20 years—for real gdp growth the unemployment 
rate and total pce price inflation those measures are 
represented graphically in the “fan charts” shown in the 
top panels of figures 4a 4b and 4c the fan charts 
display the median sep projections for the three variables 
surrounded by symmetric confidence intervals derived 
from the forecast errors reported in table 2 if the 
degree of uncertainty attending these projections is similar 
to the typical magnitude of past forecast errors and 
the risks around the projections are broadly balanced 
then future outcomes of these variables would have 
about a 70 percent probability of being within these confidence 
intervals for all three variables this measure of

in the fourth quarter 



 

uncertainty is substantial and generally increases as the 
forecast horizon lengthens 

participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty surrounding 
their individual economic projections are 
shown in the bottomleft panels of figures 4a 4b and 
4c participants generally continued to view the degree 
of uncertainty attached to their economic projections for 
real gdp growth and inflation as broadly similar to the 
average of the past 20 years3 a couple more participants 
than in september viewed the uncertainty around 
the unemployment rate as higher than average 

3 at the end of this summary the box “forecast uncertainty” 
discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty surrounding 
the economic forecasts and explains the approach 

used to assess the uncertainty and risks attending the participants’ 
projections 

because the fan charts are constructed to be symmetric 
around the median projections they do not reflect any 
asymmetries in the balance of risks that participants may 
see in their economic projections participants’ assessments 
of the balance of risks to their economic projections 
are shown in the bottomright panels of figures 
4a 4b and 4c most participants generally 
judged the risks to the outlook for real gdp growth the 
unemployment rate headline inflation and core inflation 
as broadly balanced—in other words as broadly 

consistent with a symmetric fan chart two more participants 
than in september saw the risks to real gdp 
growth as weighted to the downside and one less judged 
the risks as weighted to the upside the balance of risks 
to the projection for the unemployment rate was unchanged 
with three participants judging the risks to the 
unemployment rate as weighted to the downside and 
two participants viewing the risks as weighted to the upside 
in addition the balance of risks to the inflation 
projections shifted down slightly relative to september 
as one less participant judged the risks to both total and 
core inflation as weighted to the upside and one more 
participant viewed the risks as weighted to the downside 

in discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their 
economic projections participants mentioned trade tensions 
as well as financial and foreign economic developments 
as sources of uncertainty or downside risk to the 
growth outlook for the inflation outlook the effects of 
trade restrictions were cited as upside risks and lower energy 
prices and the stronger dollar as downside risks 
those who commented on us fiscal policy viewed it as 
an additional source of uncertainty and noted that it 
might present twosided risks to the outlook as its effects 
could be waning faster than expected or turn out 
to be more stimulative than anticipated 

participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path 
of the federal funds rate were also subject to considerable 
uncertainty because the committee adjusts the federal 
funds rate in response to actual and prospective developments 
over time in real gdp growth the unemployment 
rate and inflation uncertainty surrounding the 
projected path for the federal funds rate importantly reflects 
the uncertainties about the paths for those key economic 
variables along with other factors figure 5 provides 
a graphical representation of this uncertainty plotting 
the median sep projection for the federal funds rate 
surrounded by confidence intervals derived from the results 
presented in table 2 as with the macroeconomic 
variables the forecast uncertainty surrounding the appropriate 
path of the federal funds rate is substantial and 
increases for longer horizons 


 

 

forecast uncertainty 

the economic projections provided by the members of 
the board of governors and the presidents of the federal 
reserve banks inform discussions of monetary policy among 
policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis 
for policy actions considerable uncertainty attends these 
projections however the economic and statistical models 
and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts 
are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world and 
the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad 
unforeseen developments and events thus in setting the 
stance of monetary policy participants consider not only 
what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied 
in their projections but also the range of alternative 
possibilities the likelihood of their occurring and the potential 
costs to the economy should they occur 

table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a 
range of forecasts including those reported in past monetary 
policy reports and those prepared by the federal reserve 
board’s staff in advance of meetings of the federal open 
market committee fomc the projection error ranges 
shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated 
with economic forecasts for example suppose a 
participant projects that real gross domestic product gdp 
and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of 
respectively 3 percent and 2 percent if the uncertainty attending 
those projections is similar to that experienced in the 
past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced 
the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability 
of about 70 percent that actual gdp would expand 
within a range of 22 to 38 percent in the current year 14 to 
46 percent in the second year and 09 to 51 percent in the 
third and fourth years the corresponding 70 percent confidence 
intervals for overall inflation would be 18 to 22 percent 
in the current year and 10 to 30 percent in the second 
third and fourth years figures 4a through 4c illustrate 
these confidence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric 
and centered on the medians of fomc participants’ projections 
for gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation 
however in some instances the risks around the projections 
may not be symmetric in particular the unemployment 
rate cannot be negative furthermore the risks around 
a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or 
the downside in which case the corresponding fan chart 
would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection 


because current conditions may differ from those that 
prevailed on average over history participants provide 
judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their 
projections of each economic variable is greater than smaller 
than or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty 
seen in the past 20 years as presented in table 2 and 
reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in 
the top panels of figures 4a through 4c participants’ current 
assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec 

tions are summarized in the bottomleft panels of those figures 
participants also provide judgments as to whether the 
risks to their projections are weighted to the upside are 
weighted to the downside or are broadly balanced that is 
while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top 
panels of figures 4a through 4c imply that the risks to participants’ 
projections are balanced participants may judge that 
there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather 
than below their projections these judgments are summarized 
in the lowerright panels of figures 4a through 4c 

as with real activity and inflation the outlook for the 
future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable 
uncertainty this uncertainty arises primarily because each 
participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary 
policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity 
and inflation over time if economic conditions evolve 
in an unexpected manner then assessments of the appropriate 
setting of the federal funds rate would change from that 
point forward the final line in table 2 shows the error ranges 
for forecasts of shortterm interest rates they suggest that 
the historical confidence intervals associated with projections 
of the federal funds rate are quite wide it should be noted 
however that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent 
with the projections for the federal funds rate as these 
projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes 
but rather are projections of participants’ individual assessments 
of appropriate monetary policy and are on an endof
year basis however the forecast errors should provide a 
sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal 
funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic 
variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary 
policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of 
shocks to the economy 

if at some point in the future the confidence interval 
around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero it 
would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart 
shown in figure 5 zero is the bottom of the lowest target 
range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the 
committee in the past this approach to the construction of 
the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention 
it would not have any implications for possible future policy 
decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide 
additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so 
were appropriate in such situations the committee could 
also employ other tools including forward guidance and asset 
purchases to provide additional accommodation 

while figures 4a through 4c provide information on 
the uncertainty around the economic projections figure 1 
provides information on the range of views across fomc 
participants a comparison of figure 1 with figures 4a 
through 4c shows that the dispersion of the projections 
across participants is much smaller than the average forecast 
errors over the past 20 years
