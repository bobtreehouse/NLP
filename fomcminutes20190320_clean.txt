balance sheet normalization 
committee participants resumed their discussion from 
the january 2019 meeting on options for transitioning to 
the longerrun size of the balance sheet the staff described 
options for ending the reduction in the federal 
reserve’s securities holdings at the end of september 
2019 and for potentially reducing the pace of redemptions 
of treasury securities before that date reducing 
the pace of redemptions before ending them would be 
consistent with most previous changes in the federal 
reserve’s balance sheet policy and would support a gradual 
transition to the longrun level of reserves it could 
also reinforce the committee’s communications indicating 
that the fomc was flexible in its plans for balance 
sheet normalization and that the process of balance 
sheet normalization would remain consistent with the attainment 
of the federal reserve’s monetary policy objectives 
however continuing redemptions at the current 
pace through september might be simpler to communicate 
and would somewhat shorten the transition to 
the longrun level of reserves the staff noted that reducing 
the pace of redemptions before september 
would leave reserves and the balance sheet slightly larger 
than continuing redemptions at the current pace through 
september however the longerrun level of reserves 
and size of the balance sheet would ultimately be determined 
by longterm demand for federal reserve liabilities 
staff projections of term premiums and macroeconomic 
outcomes did not differ substantially across the 
two options 
the staff also described a possible interim plan for reinvesting 
principal payments received from agency debt 
page 2federal open market committee

and agency mortgagebacked securities mbs after balance 
sheet runoff ends and until the committee decides 
on the longerrun composition of the system open market 
account soma portfolio consistent with the 
committee’s longstanding aim to hold primarily treasury 
securities in the longer run any principal payments 
on agency debt and agency mbs would generally be reinvested 
in treasury securities in the secondary market 
these reinvestments would be allocated across sectors 
of the treasury market roughly in proportion to the maturity 
composition of treasury securities outstanding 
however the plan would maintain the existing 20 billion 
per month cap on mbs redemptions principal payments 
on agency debt and agency mbs above 20 billion 
per month would continue to be reinvested in agency 
mbs this cap would limit the pace at which the federal 
reserve’s agency mbs holdings could decline if prepayments 
accelerated the staff projected that the redemption 
cap on agency debt and agency mbs was unlikely to 
be reached after 2019 
the staff noted that once balance sheet runoff ended 
the average level of reserves would tend to decline gradually 
in line with trend growth in the federal reserve’s 
nonreserve liabilities until the committee chose to resume 
growth of the balance sheet in order to maintain a 
level of reserves consistent with efficient and effective 
policy implementation 
participants judged that ending the runoff of securities 
holdings at the end of september would reduce uncertainty 
about the federal reserve’s plans for its securities 
holdings and would be consistent with the committee’s 
decision at its january 2019 meeting to continue implementing 
monetary policy in a regime of ample reserves 
participants discussed advantages and disadvantages of 
slowing balance sheet runoff before the september stopping 
date a slowing in the pace of redemptions would 
accord with the committee’s general practice of adjusting 
its holdings of securities smoothly and predictably 
which might reduce the risk that market volatility would 
arise in connection with the conclusion of the runoff of 
securities holdings however these advantages needed 
to be weighed against the additional complexity of a plan 
that would end balance sheet runoff in steps rather than 
all at once 
participants reiterated their support for the fomc’s intention 
to return to holding primarily treasury securities 
in the long run participants judged that adopting an interim 
approach for reinvesting agency debt and agency 
mbs principal payments into treasury securities across 
a range of maturities was appropriate while the committee 
continued to evaluate potential longrun maturity 
structures for the federal reserve’s portfolio of treasury 
securities many participants offered preliminary 
views on advantages and disadvantages of alternative 
compositions for the soma portfolio participants expected 
to further discuss the longerrun composition of 
the portfolio at upcoming meetings 
participants commented on considerations related to allowing 
the average level of reserves to decline in line 
with trend growth in nonreserve liabilities for a time after 
the end of balance sheet runoff several participants 
preferred to stabilize the average level of reserves by resuming 
purchases of treasury securities relatively soon 
after the end of runoff because they saw little benefit to 
further declines in reserve balances or because they 
thought the committee should minimize the risk of interest 
rate volatility that could occur if the supply of reserves 
dropped below a point consistent with efficient 
and effective implementation of policy some others 
preferred to allow the average level of reserves to continue 
to decline for a longer time after balance sheet runoff 
ends because such declines could allow the committee 
to learn more about underlying reserve demand because 
they judged that such a process was not likely to 
result in excessive volatility in money market rates or 
because they judged that moving to lower levels of reserves 
was more consistent with the committee’s previous 
communications indicating that it would hold no 
more securities than necessary for implementing monetary 
policy efficiently and effectively participants noted 
that the eventual resumption of purchases of securities 
to keep pace with growth in demand for the federal reserve’s 
liabilities whenever it occurred would be a normal 
part of operations to maintain the amplereserves 
monetary policy implementation regime and would not 
represent a change in the stance of monetary policy 
some participants suggested that at future meetings the 
committee should discuss the potential benefits and 
costs of tools that might reduce reserve demand or support 
interest rate control 
following the discussion the chair proposed that the 
committee communicate its intentions regarding balance 
sheet normalization by publishing a statement at 
the conclusion of the meeting all participants agreed 
that it was appropriate to issue the proposed statement

balance sheet normalization 
principles and plans 
adopted march 20 2019 
in light of its discussions at previous meetings and the 
progress in normalizing the size of the federal reserve’s 
securities holdings and the level of reserves in the banking 
system all participants agreed that it is appropriate at 
this time for the committee to provide additional information 
regarding its plans for the size of its securities 
holdings and the transition to the longerrun operating 
regime at its january meeting the committee stated 
that it intends to continue to implement monetary policy 
in a regime in which an ample supply of reserves ensures 
that control over the level of the federal funds rate and 
other shortterm interest rates is exercised primarily 
through the setting of the federal reserve’s administered 
rates and in which active management of the supply 
of reserves is not required the statement regarding 
monetary policy implementation and balance sheet 
normalization released in january as well as the principles 
and plans listed below together revise and replace 
the committee’s earlier policy normalization principles 
and plans 
 to ensure a smooth transition to the longerrun 
level of reserves consistent with efficient and effective 
policy implementation the committee intends 
to slow the pace of the decline in reserves over coming 
quarters provided that the economy and money 
market conditions evolve about as expected 
o the committee intends to slow the reduction 
of its holdings of treasury securities by reducing 
the cap on monthly redemptions from the 
current level of 30 billion to 15 billion beginning 
in may 2019 
o the committee intends to conclude the reduction 
of its aggregate securities holdings in the 
system open market account soma at the 
end of september 2019 
o the committee intends to continue to allow its 
holdings of agency debt and agency mortgagebacked 
securities mbs to decline consistent 
with the aim of holding primarily treasury securities 
in the longer run 
 beginning in october 2019 principal payments 
received from agency debt and 
agency mbs will be reinvested in treasury 
securities subject to a maximum amount of 
20 billion per month any principal payments 
in excess of that maximum will continue 
to be reinvested in agency mbs 
 principal payments from agency debt and 
agency mbs below the 20 billion maximum 
will initially be invested in treasury 
securities across a range of maturities to 
roughly match the maturity composition of 
treasury securities outstanding the committee 
will revisit this reinvestment plan in 
connection with its deliberations regarding 
the longerrun composition of the soma 
portfolio 
 it continues to be the committee’s view 
that limited sales of agency mbs might be 
warranted in the longer run to reduce or 
eliminate residual holdings the timing and 
pace of any sales would be communicated 
to the public well in advance 
o the average level of reserves after the fomc 
has concluded the reduction of its aggregate securities 
holdings at the end of september will 
likely still be somewhat above the level of reserves 
necessary to efficiently and effectively 
implement monetary policy 
 in that case the committee currently anticipates 
that it will likely hold the size of the 
soma portfolio roughly constant for a 
time during such a period persistent gradual 
increases in currency and other nonreserve 
liabilities would be accompanied by 
corresponding gradual declines in reserve 
balances to a level consistent with efficient 
and effective implementation of monetary 
policy 
o when the committee judges that reserve balances 
have declined to this level the soma 
portfolio will hold no more securities than necessary 
for efficient and effective policy implementation 
once that point is reached the 
committee will begin increasing its securities 
holdings to keep pace with trend growth of the 
federal reserve’s nonreserve liabilities and 
maintain an appropriate level of reserves in the 
system 
developments in financial markets and open 
market operations 
the manager of the soma discussed developments in 
global financial markets over the intermeeting period in 
page 4federal open market committee

the united states equity indexes moved higher and 
credit spreads tightened market participants attributed 
these moves largely to a perceived shift in the fomc’s 
approach to policy following communications stressing 
that the committee would be patient in assessing the 
need for future adjustments in the target range for the 
federal funds rate and would be flexible on balance sheet 
policy 
in europe measures announced by the european central 
bank ecb in march including an extension of forward 
guidance on interest rates and the announcement 
of another round of targeted longterm refinancing operations 
were followed by a decline in euroarea equity 
markets particularly bank stocks as well as declines in 
euroarea rates market contacts attributed the price reaction 
to a perception that the measures were not as 
stimulative as might have been expected given downward 
revisions in the ecb’s growth and inflation forecasts 
in china authorities moved toward an easier fiscal 
and monetary stance china’s aggregate credit growth 
had rebounded slightly in recent months relative to the 
declining trend observed last year the shanghai composite 
index had risen notably since the turn of the year 
driven in part by fiscal and monetary stimulus measures 
as well as perceived progress on trade negotiations developments 
around brexit remained a source of market 
uncertainty consistent with ongoing investor uncertainty 
over the outcome risk reversals on the pound– 
dollar currency pair continued to point to higher demand 
for protection against pound depreciation relative 
to the dollar 
the deputy manager provided an overview of money 
market developments and policy implementation over 
the intermeeting period the effective federal funds rate 
effr continued to be very stable at a level equal to the 
interest rate on excess reserves rates in overnight secured 
markets continued to exhibit some volatility particularly 
on monthend dates market participants attributed 
some of the volatility in overnight secured rates 
to persistently high net dealer inventories of treasury securities 
and to treasury issuance coinciding with the 
monthend statement dates over the upcoming intermeeting 
period with the combination of changes in the 
treasury’s balances at the federal reserve and additional 
asset redemptions reserves were expected to decline to 
a new low of around 14 trillion by early may with some 
notable fluctuations in reserves on days associated with 
tax flows 
the deputy manager also discussed the transition to a 
longrun regime of ample reserves following the committee’s 
january announcement that it intends to continue 
to implement monetary policy in such a regime 
once the size of the federal reserve’s balance sheet has 
normalized the open market desk will at some point 
need to conduct open market operations to maintain a 
level of reserves in the banking system that the committee 
deems appropriate in doing so the desk will need 
to assess banks’ demand for reserves as well as forecast 
other federal reserve liabilities and plan operations to 
maintain a supply of reserves sufficient to ensure that 
control over shortterm interest rates is exercised primarily 
through the setting of administered rates 
the deputy manager described a possible operational approach 
in an amplereserves regime based on establishing 
a minimum operating level that would be a lower 
bound on the daily level of reserves the assessment of 
the minimum operating level of reserves would be based 
on a range of information including surveys of banks 
and market participants data on banks’ reserve holdings 
and market monitoring under the proposed approach 
the desk would plan open market operations to maintain 
the daily level of reserves above the minimum operating 
level consistent with the committee’s intention 
to maintain a regime that does not require active management 
of the supply of reserves the desk could plan 
these open market operations over a mediumterm horizon 
the average level of reserves over the medium 
term would then be above the minimum operating level 
providing a buffer of reserves to absorb daily changes in 
nonreserve liabilities 
following the manager and deputy manager’s report 
some participants commented on various aspects of the 
minimum operating level approach decisions regarding 
how far to allow reserves to decline would need to balance 
important tradeoffs on the one hand a lower 
minimum operating level might increase the risk of excessive 
interest rate volatility on the other hand a 
lower minimum operating level could provide more opportunities 
to learn about underlying reserve demand or 
could be viewed as more consistent with moving to the 
smallest securities holdings necessary for efficient and 
effective monetary policy implementation however 
the scope for reducing the level of reserves much further 
after the end of balance sheet runoff might be fairly limited 
by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desk’s 
domestic transactions over the intermeeting period 
minutes of the meeting of march 19–20 2019page 5

there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies 
for the system’s account during the intermeeting period 
staff review of the economic situation 
the information available for the march 19–20 meeting 
indicated that labor market conditions remained strong 
although growth in real gross domestic product gdp 
appeared to have slowed markedly in the first quarter of 
this year from its solid fourthquarter pace consumer 
price inflation as measured by the 12month percentage 
change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures 
pce was somewhat below 2 percent in december 
held down in part by recent declines in consumer 
energy prices while pce price inflation for items 
other than food and energy was close to 2 percent more 
recent readings on pce price inflation were delayed by 
the earlier federal government shutdown surveybased 
measures of longerrun inflation expectations were little 
changed on balance 
increases in total nonfarm payroll employment remained 
solid on average in recent months employment 
rose only a little in february but had expanded strongly 
in january the national unemployment rate edged 
down on net over the past two months to 38 percent 
in february and both the labor force participation rate 
and the employmenttopopulation ratio rose slightly on 
balance the unemployment rates for african americans 
asians and hispanics in february were at or below 
their levels at the end of the previous economic expansion 
though persistent differentials in unemployment 
rates across groups remained the share of workers employed 
part time for economic reasons moved down in 
february and was below the lows reached in late 2007 
the rate of privatesector job openings in january was 
the same as its fourthquarter average and remained elevated 
while the rate of quits edged up in january the 
fourweek moving average of initial claims for unemployment 
insurance benefits through early march was 
still near historically low levels average hourly earnings 
for all employees rose 34 percent over the 12 months 
ending in february a significantly faster pace than a year 
earlier the employment cost index for privatesector 
workers increased 3 percent over the 12 months ending 
in december somewhat faster than a year earlier total 
labor compensation per hour in the business sector increased 
29 percent over the four quarters of 2018 about 
the same rate as a year earlier 
industrial production declined in january and rebounded 
only somewhat in february moreover manufacturing 
output decreased over both months as production in 
the motor vehicle and parts sector contracted notably in 
january and declines were more broad based in february 
production in the mining and utilities sectors expanded 
on net over the past two months automakers’ 
assembly schedules suggested that the production of 
light motor vehicles would be roughly flat in the near 
term and new orders indexes from national and regional 
manufacturing surveys pointed to only modest gains in 
overall factory output in the coming months 
household spending looked to be slowing around the 
turn of the year real pce decreased markedly in december 
after a solid increase in the previous month and 
the components of the nominal retail sales data used by 
the bureau of economic analysis bea to estimate 
pce rebounded only partially in january key factors 
that influence consumer spending—including a low unemployment 
rate ongoing gains in real labor compensation 
and still elevated measures of households’ net 
worth—were supportive of a pickup in consumer 
spending to a solid pace in the near term in addition 
consumer sentiment as measured by the university of 
michigan surveys of consumers stepped up in february 
and early march to an upbeat level 
real residential investment appeared to be softening further 
in the first quarter likely reflecting in part decreases 
in the affordability of housing arising from both 
the net increase in mortgage interest rates over the past 
year and ongoing house price appreciation starts of 
new singlefamily homes increased slightly on net over 
december and january while starts of multifamily units 
declined building permit issuance for new singlefamily 
homes—which tends to be a good indicator of the underlying 
trend in construction of such homes—moved 
down over those two months in addition sales of both 
new and existing homes decreased in january 
growth in real private expenditures for business equipment 
and intellectual property looked to be slowing in 
the first quarter nominal shipments of nondefense capital 
goods excluding aircraft rose in december and january 
while available indicators pointed to a decrease in 
transportation equipment spending in the first quarter 
after a strong fourthquarter gain forwardlooking indicators 
of business equipment spending—such as orders 
for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft and 
readings on business sentiment—pointed to sluggish increases 
in the near term nominal business expenditures 
for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and 
mining sector increased in december and january in 
addition the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in 
page 6federal open market committee

operation—an indicator of business spending for structures 
in the drilling and mining sector—expanded on 
balance in february and through the middle of march 
total real government purchases appeared to be moving 
sideways in the first quarter relatively strong increases 
in real federal defense purchases were likely to be 
roughly offset by an expected decline in real nondefense 
purchases stemming from the effects of the partial federal 
government shutdown real purchases by state and 
local governments looked to be rising modestly in the 
first quarter as the payrolls of those governments expanded 
a bit in january and february and nominal state 
and local construction spending rose on net in december 
and january 
the nominal us international trade deficit narrowed in 
november before widening in december to the largest 
deficit since 2008 exports declined in november and 
december as exports of industrial supplies and automotive 
products fell in both months imports decreased in 
november before partially recovering in december 
with imports of consumer goods and industrial supplies 
driving this swing the bea estimated that the change 
in net exports was a drag of about ¼ percentage point 
on the rate of real gdp growth in the fourth quarter 
total us consumer prices as measured by the pce 
price index increased 17 percent over the 12 months 
ending in december slightly slower than a year earlier 
as consumer energy prices declined a little and consumer 
food prices rose only modestly core pce price inflation 
which excludes changes in consumer food and energy 
prices was 19 percent over that same period somewhat 
higher than a year earlier the consumer price index 
cpi rose 15 percent over the 12 months ending in 
february while core cpi inflation was 21 percent recent 
readings on surveybased measures of longerrun 
inflation expectations—including those from the michigan 
survey the blue chip economic indicators and the 
desk’s survey of primary dealers and survey of market 
participants—were little changed on balance 
economic growth in foreign economies slowed further 
in the fourth quarter this development reflected slowing 
in the canadian economy and some emerging market 
economies emes including brazil and mexico along 
with continued economic weakness in the euro area and 
china in the advanced foreign economies afes recent 
data suggested that economic activity especially in 
the manufacturing sector remained subdued in the first 
quarter of this year economic activity also remained 
weak in many emes particularly in mexico and emerging 
asia excluding china although some data pointed to 
a modest pickup in china inflation in foreign economies 
slowed further early this year partly reflecting 
lower retail energy prices across both afes and emes 
staff review of the financial situation 
investor sentiment toward risky assets continued to improve 
over the intermeeting period market participants 
cited accommodative monetary policy communications 
and optimism for a trade deal between the united states 
and china as factors that contributed to the improvement 
broad equity price indexes increased notably corporate 
bond spreads narrowed and measures of equity 
market volatility declined meanwhile financing conditions 
for businesses and households improved slightly 
and generally remained supportive of economic activity 
fomc communications issued following the january 
meeting were generally viewed by market participants as 
more accommodative than expected subsequent communications—
including the minutes of the january 
fomc meeting the chair’s semiannual testimony to the 
congress and speeches by fomc participants—were 
interpreted as reflecting a patient approach to monetary 
policy in the near term and a likely conclusion to the 
federal reserve’s balance sheet reduction by the end of 
this year the marketimplied path for the federal funds 
rate in 2019 declined slightly over the period while investors 
continued to expect no change to the target 
range for the federal funds rate at the march fomc 
meeting the marketimplied path of the federal funds 
rate for 2020 and 2021 shifted down a little 
yields on nominal treasury securities declined a bit 
across the treasury yield curve over the intermeeting period 
communications from fomc participants that 
were more accommodative than expected amid muted 
readings on inflation communications from other major 
central banks that on balance were also regarded as 
more accommodative than expected and generally 
mixed economic data releases reportedly contributed to 
the decrease in yields and outweighed improved risk sentiment 
the spread between the yields on nominal 
10 and 2year treasury securities was little changed over 
the period and remained in the lower end of its historical 
range of recent decades measures of inflation compensation 
derived from treasury inflationprotected securities 
increased modestly on net although they remained 
below levels seen last fall 
major us equity price indexes increased over the intermeeting 
period with broadbased gains across sectors 
improved prospects for a trade deal between the united 
states and china and accommodative monetary policy 
were cited as driving factors that outweighed weaker

was consistently equal to the rate of interest on excess 
reserves while takeup in the overnight reverse repurchase

commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit 
generally narrowed further from their elevated yearend 
levels likely reflecting an increase in investor demand for 
shortterm financial assets meanwhile the statutory 
federal government debt ceiling was reestablished at 
22 trillion on march 1 
the prices of foreign risky assets broadly tracked the 
positive moves in similar us assets over the intermeeting 
period communications by major central banks 
which were on net more accommodative than expected 
along with optimism regarding trade negotiations 
between the united states and china contributed 
to the upward price moves and more than offset the effects 
of continued concerns about foreign economic 
growth in particular global equity prices generally 
ended the period higher and dedicated emerging market 
funds continued to see inflows at the same time longterm 
afe yields declined somewhat on net on communications 
from major foreign central banks and investors’ 
concerns about foreign economic growth 
the broad dollar index appreciated slightly as the extension 
of accommodative policies and revised guidance by 
major foreign central banks weighed on afe currencies 
an exception was the british pound which strengthened 
a bit against the dollar as market participants viewed recent 
parliamentary votes as reducing the likelihood of a 
nodeal brexit 
financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses continued 
to be accommodative overall gross issuance of 
both investmentgrade and highyield corporate bonds 
was strong in january and february recovering from the 
low levels observed late last year issuance in the institutional 
syndicated leveraged loan market also recovered 
in the first two months of the year as new issuance in 
february was in line with average monthly new issuance 
in 2018 and spreads narrowed somewhat from their december

staff economic outlook 
the us economic projection prepared by the staff for 
the march fomc meeting was revised down a little on 
balance this revision reflected the effects of weakerthan
expected incoming data on both aggregate domestic 
spending and foreign economic growth that were 
only partially offset by a somewhat higher projected path 
for domestic equity prices and a lower projected trajectory 
for interest rates the staff forecast that us real 
gdp growth would slow markedly in the first quarter 
reflecting a softening in growth of both consumer 
spending and business investment but the staff judged 
that the firstquarter slowdown would be transitory and 
that real gdp growth would bounce back solidly in the 
page 8federal open market committee

second quarter in the mediumterm projection real 
gdp growth was forecast to run at a rate similar to the 
staff’s estimate of potential output growth in 2019 and 
2020—a somewhat lower trajectory on net for real 
gdp than in the previous projection—and then slow to 
a pace below potential output growth in 2021 the staff 
revised up slightly its assumed underlying trend in the 
labor force participation rate raising the level of potential 
output a bit which contributed—along with the 
lower projected path for real gdp—to an assessment 
that resource utilization was a little less tight than in the 
previous forecast the unemployment rate was projected 
to decline a little further below the staff’s estimate 
of its longerrun natural rate but to bottom out by the 
end of this year and begin to edge up in 2021 with labor 
market conditions judged to still be tight the staff continued 
to assume that projected employment gains 
would manifest in smallerthanusual downward pressure 
on the unemployment rate and in largerthanusual 
upward pressure on the labor force participation rate 
the staff’s forecast for inflation was revised down 
slightly for the march fomc meeting reflecting some 
recent softerthanexpected readings on consumer 
prices core pce price inflation was expected to remain 
at 19 percent over this year as a whole and then to edge 
up to 2 percent for the remainder of the medium term 
total pce price inflation was forecast to run a bit below 
core inflation over the next three years reflecting projected 
declines in energy prices 
the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections 
for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation 
as generally similar to the average of the past 
20 years the staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for 
real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as roughly 
balanced on the upside household spending and business 
investment could expand faster than the staff projected 
supported by the tax cuts enacted at the end of 
2017 still strong overall labor market conditions and 
upbeat consumer sentiment in addition financial conditions 
might not tighten as much as assumed in the staff 
forecast on the downside the recent softening in a 
number of economic indicators could be the harbinger 
of a substantial deterioration in economic activity 
moreover trade policies and foreign economic developments 
could move in directions that have significant 
negative effects on us economic growth risks to the 
inflation projection also were seen as balanced the upside 
risk that inflation could increase more than expected 
in an economy that is still projected to be operating notably 
above potential for an extended period was counterbalanced 
by the downside risk that longerterm inflation 
expectations may be lower than was assumed in the 
staff forecast as well as the possibility that the dollar 
could appreciate if foreign economic conditions deteriorated 
participants’ views on current conditions and the 
economic outlook 
in conjunction with this fomc meeting members of 
the board of governors and federal reserve bank presidents 
submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes 
for real gdp growth the unemployment rate 
and inflation for each year from 2019 through 2021 and 
over the longer run based on their individual assessments 
of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate 
the longerrun projections represented each participant’s 
assessment of the rate to which each variable 
would be expected to converge over time under appropriate 
monetary policy and in the absence of further 
shocks to the economy these projections and policy 
assessments are described in the summary of economic 
projections sep which is an addendum to these 
minutes 
participants agreed that information received since the 
january meeting indicated that the labor market had remained 
strong but that growth of economic activity had 
slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter payroll 
employment was little changed in february but job 
gains had been solid on average in recent months and 
the unemployment rate had remained low recent indicators 
pointed to slower growth of household spending 
and business fixed investment in the first quarter on a 
12month basis overall inflation had declined largely as 
a result of lower energy prices inflation for items other 
than food and energy remained near 2 percent on balance 
marketbased measures of inflation compensation 
had remained low in recent months and surveybased 
measures of longerterm inflation expectations were little 
changed 
participants continued to view a sustained expansion of 
economic activity strong labor market conditions and 
inflation near the committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective 
as the most likely outcomes over the next few 
years underlying economic fundamentals continued to 
support sustained expansion and most participants indicated 
that they did not expect the recent weakness in 
spending to persist beyond the first quarter nevertheless 
participants generally expected the growth rate of 
real gdp this year to step down from the pace seen over 
2018 to a rate at or modestly above their estimates of 
longerrun growth participants cited various factors as 
minutes of the meeting of march 19–20 2019page 9

likely to contribute to the stepdown including slower 
foreign growth and waning effects of fiscal stimulus a 
number of participants judged that economic growth in 
the remaining quarters of 2019 and in the subsequent 
couple of years would likely be a little lower on balance 
than they had previously forecast reasons cited for 
these downward revisions included disappointing news 
on global growth and less of a boost from fiscal policy 
than had previously been anticipated 
in their discussion of the household sector participants 
noted that softness in consumer spending had contributed 
importantly to the projected slowing in economic 
growth in the current quarter many participants 
pointed to the weakness in retail sales in december as 
notable although they recognized that the data for january 
had shown a partial recovery in retail sales participants 
also observed that much of the recent softness 
likely reflected temporary factors such as the partial federal 
government shutdown and december’s volatility in 
financial markets and that consumer sentiment had recovered 
after these factors had receded consequently 
many participants expected consumer spending to proceed 
at a stronger pace in coming months supported by 
favorable underlying factors including a strong labor 
market solid growth in household incomes improvements 
in financial conditions and in households’ balance 
sheet positions and upbeat consumer sentiment participants 
noted however that the continued softness in 
the housing sector was a concern 
participants also commented on the apparent slowing of 
growth in business fixed investment in the first quarter 
factors cited as consistent with the recent softness in investment 
growth included downward revisions in forecasts 
of corporate earnings relatively low energy prices 
that provided less incentive for new drilling and exploration 
flattening capital goods orders reports from contacts 
of softer export sales and of weaker economic activity 
abroad elevated levels of uncertainty about government 
policies including trade policies and the likely 
effect of recent financial market volatility on business 
sentiment however many participants pointed to signs 
that the weakness in investment would likely abate 
some contacts in manufacturing and other sectors reported 
that business conditions were favorable with 
strong demand for labor business sentiment had recovered 
from its recent decline and recent reductions in 
mortgage interest rates would provide some support for 
construction activity agricultural activity remained 
weak in various areas of the country with the weakness 
in part reflecting adverse effects of trade policy on commodity 
prices recent widespread severe flooding had 
also adversely affected the agricultural sector 
participants noted that the latest readings on overall inflation 
had been somewhat softer than expected however 
participants observed that these readings largely reflected 
the effects of earlier declines in crude oil prices 
and that core inflation remained near 2 percent most 
participants while seeing inflation pressures as muted 
expected the overall rate of inflation to firm somewhat 
and to be at or near the committee’s longerrun objective 
of 2 percent over the next few years many participants 
indicated that while inflation had been close to 
2 percent last year it was noteworthy that it had not 
shown greater signs of firming in response to strong labor 
market conditions and rising nominal wage growth 
as well as to the shortterm upward pressure on prices 
arising from tariff increases low rates of price increases 
in sectors of the economy that were not cyclically sensitive 
were cited by a couple of participants as one reason 
for the recent easing in inflation a few participants observed 
that the pickup in productivity growth last year 
was a welcome development helping to bolster potential 
output and damp inflationary pressures 
in their discussion of indicators of inflation expectations 
participants noted that marketbased measures of 
inflation compensation had risen modestly over the intermeeting 
period although they remained low a couple 
of participants stressed that recent readings on survey 
measures of inflation expectations were also still at 
low levels several participants suggested that longerterm 
inflation expectations could be at levels somewhat 
below those consistent with the committee’s 2 percent 
inflation objective and that this might make it more difficult 
to achieve that objective on a sustained basis 
in their discussion of the labor market participants cited 
evidence that conditions remained strong including the 
very low unemployment rate a further increase in the 
labor force participation rate a low number of layoffs 
nearrecord levels of job openings and helpwanted 
postings and solid job gains on average in recent 
months participants observed that following strong 
job gains in january there had been little growth in payrolls 
in february although a few participants pointed out 
that the february reading had likely been affected by adverse 
weather conditions a couple of participants 
noted that over the medium term some easing in payroll 
growth was to be expected as economic growth 
slowed to its longerrun trend rate reports from business 
contacts predominantly pointed to continued 
page 10federal open market committee

strong labor demand with firms offering both higher 
wages and more nonwage benefits to attract workers 
economywide wage growth was seen as being broadly 
consistent with recent rates of labor productivity growth 
and with inflation of 2 percent a few participants cited 
the combination of muted inflation pressures and expanding 
employment as a possible indication that some 
slack remained in the labor market 
participants commented on a number of risks associated 
with their outlook for economic activity a few participants 
noted that there remained a high level of uncertainty 
associated with international developments including 
ongoing trade talks and brexit deliberations although 
a couple of participants remarked that the risks 
of adverse outcomes were somewhat lower than in january 
other downside risks included the possibility of 
sizable spillovers from a greaterthanexpected economic 
slowdown in europe and china persistence of 
the softness in spending or a sharp falloff in fiscal stimulus 
a few participants observed that an economic deterioration 
in the united states if it occurred might be 
amplified by significant debt service burdens for many 
firms participants also mentioned a number of upside 
risks regarding the outlook for economic activity including 
outcomes in which various sources of uncertainty 
were resolved favorably consumer and business sentiment 
rebounded sharply or the recent strengthening in 
labor productivity growth signaled a pickup in the underlying 
trend upside risks to the outlook for inflation 
included the possibility that wage pressures could rise 
unexpectedly and lead to greaterthanexpected price increases 
in their discussion of financial developments participants 
observed that a good deal of the tightening over 
the latter part of last year in financial conditions had 
since been reversed federal reserve communications 
since the beginning of this year were seen as an important 
contributor to the recent improvements in financial 
conditions participants noted that asset valuations 
had recovered strongly and also discussed the decline 
that had occurred in recent months in yields on 
longerterm treasury securities several participants expressed 
concern that the yield curve for treasury securities 
was now quite flat and noted that historical evidence 
suggested that an inverted yield curve could portend 
economic weakness however their discussion also 
noted that the unusually low level of term premiums in 
longerterm interest rates made historical relationships a 
less reliable basis for assessing the implications of the 
recent behavior of the yield curve several participants 
pointed to the increased debt issuance and higher leverage 
of nonfinancial corporations as a development that 
warranted continued monitoring 
in their discussion of monetary policy decisions at the 
current meeting participants agreed that it would be appropriate 
to maintain the current target range for the 
federal funds rate at 2¼ to 2½ percent participants 
judged that the labor market remained strong but that 
information received over the intermeeting period including 
recent readings on household spending and 
business fixed investment pointed to slower economic 
growth in the early part of this year than in the fourth 
quarter of 2018 despite these indications of softer firstquarter 
growth participants generally expected economic 
activity to continue to expand labor markets to 
remain strong and inflation to remain near 2 percent 
participants also noted significant uncertainties surrounding 
their economic outlooks including those related 
to global economic and financial developments in 
light of these uncertainties as well as continued evidence 
of muted inflation pressures participants generally 
agreed that a patient approach to determining future adjustments 
to the target range for the federal funds rate 
remained appropriate several participants observed 
that the characterization of the committee’s approach to 
monetary policy as “patient” would need to be reviewed 
regularly as the economic outlook and uncertainties surrounding 
the outlook evolve a couple of participants 
noted that the “patient” characterization should not be 
seen as limiting the committee’s options for making policy 
adjustments when they are deemed appropriate 
with regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond 
this meeting a majority of participants expected that the 
evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook 
would likely warrant leaving the target range unchanged 
for the remainder of the year several of these 
participants noted that the current target range for the 
federal funds rate was close to their estimates of its 
longerrun neutral level and foresaw economic growth 
continuing near its longerrun trend rate over the forecast 
period participants continued to emphasize that 
their decisions about the appropriate target range for the 
federal funds rate at coming meetings would depend on 
their ongoing assessments of the economic outlook as 
informed by a wide range of data as well as on how the 
risks to the outlook evolved several participants noted 
that their views of the appropriate target range for the 
federal funds rate could shift in either direction based on 
incoming data and other developments some participants 
indicated that if the economy evolved as they currently 
expected with economic growth above its longer 
minutes of the meeting of march 19–20 2019page 11

run trend rate they would likely judge it appropriate to 
raise the target range for the federal funds rate modestly 
later this year 
several participants expressed concerns that the public 
had at times misinterpreted the medians of participants’ 
assessments of the appropriate level for the federal 
funds rate presented in the sep as representing the consensus 
view of the committee or as suggesting that policy 
was on a preset course such misinterpretations 
could complicate the committee’s communications regarding 
its view of appropriate monetary policy particularly 
in circumstances when the future course of policy 
is unusually uncertain nonetheless several participants 
noted that the policy rate projections in the sep are a 
valuable component of the overall information provided 
about the monetary policy outlook the chair noted 
that he had asked the subcommittee on communications 
to consider ways to improve the information contained 
in the sep and to improve communications regarding 
the role of the federal funds rate projections in the sep 
as part of the policy process 
participants also discussed alternative interpretations of 
subdued inflation pressures in current economic circumstances 
and the associated policy implications several 
participants observed that limited inflationary pressures 
during a period of historically low unemployment could 
be a sign that low inflation expectations were exerting 
downward pressure on inflation relative to the committee’s 
2 percent inflation target in addition subdued inflation 
pressures could indicate a less tight labor market 
than suggested by common measures of resource utilization 
consistent with these observations several participants 
noted that various indicators of inflation expectations 
had remained at the lower end of their historical 
range and a few participants commented that they had 
recently revised down their estimates of the longerrun 
unemployment rate consistent with 2 percent inflation 
in light of these considerations some participants noted 
that the appropriate response of the federal funds rate to 
signs of labor market tightening could be modest provided 
that signs of inflation pressures continued to be 
limited some participants regarded their judgments that 
the federal funds rate was likely to remain on a very flat 
trajectory as reflecting other factors such as low estimates 
of the longerrun neutral real interest rate or riskmanagement 
considerations a few participants observed 
that the appropriate path for policy insofar as it 
implied lower interest rates for longer periods of time 
could lead to greater financial stability risks however a 
couple of these participants noted that such financial stability 
risks could be addressed through appropriate use 
of countercyclical macroprudential policy tools or other 
supervisory or regulatory tools 
committee policy action 
in their discussion of monetary policy for the period 
ahead members judged that the information received 
since the committee met in january indicated that the 
labor market remained strong but that growth of economic 
activity had slowed from its solid rate in the 
fourth quarter payroll employment was little changed 
in february but job gains had been solid on average in 
recent months and the unemployment rate had remained 
low recent indicators pointed to slower growth 
of household spending and business fixed investment in 
the first quarter on a 12month basis overall inflation 
had declined largely as a result of lower energy prices 
inflation for items other than food and energy remained 
near 2 percent on balance marketbased measures of 
inflation compensation had remained low in recent 
months and surveybased measures of longerterm inflations 
expectations were little changed 
in their consideration of the economic outlook members 
noted that financial conditions had improved since 
the beginning of year but that some time would be 
needed to assess whether indications of weak economic 
growth in the first quarter would persist in subsequent 
quarters members also noted that inflationary pressures 
remained muted and that a number of uncertainties 
bearing on the us and global economic outlook still 
awaited resolution however members continued to 
view sustained expansion of economic activity strong 
labor market conditions and inflation near the committee’s 
symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely 
outcomes for the us economy in the period ahead in 
light of global economic and financial developments and 
muted inflation pressures members concurred that the 
committee could be patient as it determined what future 
adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate 
may be appropriate to support those outcomes 
after assessing current conditions and the outlook for 
economic activity the labor market and inflation members 
decided to maintain the target range for the federal 
funds rate at 2¼ to 2½ percent members agreed that 
in determining the timing and size of future adjustments 
to the target range for the federal funds rate the committee 
would assess realized and expected economic 
conditions relative to the committee’s maximumemployment 
and symmetric 2 percent inflation objectives 
they reiterated that this assessment would take 
into account a wide range of information including 
page 12federal open market committee

measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation 
pressures and inflation expectations and readings 
on financial and international developments more generally 
members noted that decisions regarding nearterm 
adjustments of the stance of monetary policy 
would appropriately remain dependent on the evolution 
of the outlook as informed by incoming data 
with regard to the postmeeting statement members 
agreed to characterize the labor market as remaining 
strong while payroll employment had been little 
changed in february job gains had been solid on average 
in recent months and the unemployment rate had 
remained low members also agreed to note that growth 
in economic activity appeared to have slowed from its 
solid rate in the fourth quarter consistent with recent 
indicators of household spending and business fixed investment 
the description of overall inflation was revised 
to recognize that inflation had declined largely as 
a result of lower energy prices while still noting that inflation 
for items other than food and energy remained 
near 2 percent 
at the conclusion of the discussion the committee 
voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank 
of new york until instructed otherwise to execute 
transactions in the soma in accordance with the following 
domestic policy directive to be released at 
200 pm 
“effective march 21 2019 the federal open 
market committee directs the desk to undertake 
open market operations as necessary to 
maintain the federal funds rate in a target range 
of 2¼ to 2½ percent including overnight reverse 
repurchase operations and reverse repurchase 
operations with maturities of more than 
one day when necessary to accommodate weekend 
holiday or similar trading conventions at 
an offering rate of 225 percent in amounts limited 
only by the value of treasury securities held 
outright in the system open market account 
that are available for such operations and by a 
percounterparty limit of 30 billion per day 
the committee directs the desk to continue 
rolling over at auction the amount of principal 
payments from the federal reserve’s holdings

summary of economic projections 
in conjunction with the federal open market committee 
fomc meeting held on march 19–20 2019 meeting 
participants submitted their projections of the most 
likely outcomes for real gross domestic product gdp 
growth the unemployment rate and inflation for each 
year from 2019 to 2021 and over the longer run each 
participant’s projections were based on information 
available at the time of the meeting together with his or 
her assessment of appropriate monetary policy—including 
a path for the federal funds rate and its longerrun 
value—and assumptions about other factors likely to affect 
economic outcomes the longerrun projections 
represent each participant’s assessment of the value to 
which each variable would be expected to converge over 
time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence 
of further shocks to the economy1 “appropriate 
monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy 
that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes 
for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy 
his or her individual interpretation of the statutory 
mandate to promote maximum employment and price 
stability 
participants who submitted longerrun projections generally 
expected that under appropriate monetary policy 
growth of real gdp in 2019 would run at or somewhat 
above their individual estimates of its longerrun rate 
most participants continued to expect real gdp growth 
to edge down over the projection horizon with almost 
all participants projecting growth in 2021 to be at or below 
their estimates of its longerrun rate all participants 
who submitted longerrun projections continued to expect 
that the unemployment rate would run at or below 
their estimates of its longerrun level through 2021 almost 
all participants projected that inflation as measured 
by the fourquarter percentage change in the price 
index for personal consumption expenditures pce 
would increase slightly over the next two years and most 
participants expected that it would be at or slightly above 
the committee’s 2 percent objective in 2020 and 2021 
compared with the summary of economic projections 
sep from december 2018 all participants marked 
down somewhat their projections for real gdp growth 
in 2019 and most revised down slightly their projections 
for total inflation in 2019 table 1 and figure 1 provide 
summary statistics for the projections 
1 one participant did not submit longerrun projections for 
real gdp growth the unemployment rate or the federal funds 
rate 
as shown in figure 2 most participants expected that 
the evolution of the economy relative to their objectives 
of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation would 
likely warrant keeping the federal funds rate at its current 
level through the end of 2019 the medians of participants’ 
assessments of the appropriate level of the federal 
funds rate in 2020 and 2021 were close to the median 
assessment of its longerrun level compared with the 
december submissions the median projections for the 
federal funds rate for the end of 2019 2020 and 2021 
were 50 basis points lower 
a substantial majority of participants continued to view 
the uncertainty around their projections as broadly similar 
to the average of the past 20 years while a majority 
of participants viewed the risks to the outlook as balanced 
a couple more participants than in december 
viewed the risks to inflation as weighted to the downside 
the outlook for economic activity 
as shown in table 1 the median of participants’ projections 
for the growth rate of real gdp in 2019 conditional 
on their individual assessments of appropriate 
monetary policy was 21 percent most participants 
continued to expect gdp growth to slow throughout 
the projection horizon with the median projection at 
19 percent in 2020 and at 18 percent in 2021 a touch 
lower than the median estimate of its longerrun rate of 
19 percent relative to the december sep the medians 
of the projections for real gdp growth in 2019 and 2020 
were 02 percentage point and 01 percentage point 
lower respectively most participants mentioned a recent 
patch of weaker data on domestic economic activity 
and some pointed to a softer global growth outlook 
as factors behind the downward revisions to their nearterm 
growth estimates 
the median of projections for the unemployment rate in 
the fourth quarter of 2019 was 37 percent about ½ percentage 
point below the median assessment of its longerrun 
level the median projections for 2020 and 2021 
were 38 percent and 39 percent respectively these 
median unemployment rates were a little higher than 
those from the december sep nevertheless most participants 
continued to project that the unemployment 
rate in 2021 would be below their estimates of its longerrun 
level the median estimate of the longerrun rate of

view the degree of uncertainty attached to their economic

because the fan charts are constructed to be symmetric 
around the median projections they do not reflect any 
asymmetries in the balance of risks that participants may 
see in their economic projections participants’ assessments 
of the balance of risks to their current economic 
projections are shown in the bottomright panels of figures 
4a 4b and 4c a majority of participants judged 
the risks to the outlook for real gdp growth the unemployment

broadly balanced—in other words as broadly consistent 
with a symmetric fan chart the balance of risks to the 
projection for real gdp growth shifted a bit lower with 
four participants assessing the risks as weighted to the 
downside and no participant seeing it weighted to the 
upside the balance of risks to the projection for the 
unemployment rate moved a touch higher with three 
participants judging the risks to the unemployment rate 
as weighted to the upside and two participants viewing 
the risks as weighted to the downside in addition the 
balance of risks to the inflation projections shifted down 
slightly relative to december two more participants 
than in december saw the risks to the inflation projections 
as weighted to the downside and no participant

ments abroad were mentioned by participants as sources 
of uncertainty or downside risk to the economic growth 
outlook for the inflation outlook the effect of trade 
restrictions was cited as an upside risk while the concern 
that inflation expectations could be drifting below the 
fomc’s objective and the potential for a stronger dollar 
and weaker domestic demand to put downward pressure 
on inflation were viewed as downside risks a number 
of participants mentioned that their assessments of risks 
remained roughly balanced in part as a result of their 
downward revisions to the appropriate federal funds rate 
path 
participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path 
of the federal funds rate are also subject to considerable 
uncertainty because the committee adjusts the federal 
funds rate in response to actual and prospective developments 
over time in key economic variables such as 
real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation 
uncertainty surrounding the projected path for the federal 
funds rate importantly reflects the uncertainties 
about the paths for these economic variables along with 
other factors figure 5 provides a graphical representation 
of this uncertainty plotting the sep median for the 
federal funds rate surrounded by confidence intervals 
derived from the results presented in table 2 as with 
the macroeconomic variables the forecast uncertainty 
surrounding the appropriate path of the federal funds 
rate is substantial and increases for longer horizons

note the blue and red lines are based on actual values and median projected values respectively of the committee’s 
target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated the actual values are the midpoint of the 
target range the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level 
the confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private 
and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years the confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the 
projections for the federal funds rate primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for 
the federal funds rate but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy 
still historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate 
generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy 
that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy 
the confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowest 
target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the committee this truncation would 
not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy 
accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate in such situations the committee could also employ other tools 
including forward guidance and largescale asset purchases to provide additional accommodation because current 
conditions may differ from those that prevailed on average over the previous 20 years the width and shape of the 
confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect fomc participants’ current 
assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections 
 the confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of shortterm interest rates in the fourth 
quarter of the year indicated more information about these data is available in table 2 the shaded area encompasses 
less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero

forecast uncertainty 
the economic projections provided by the members of 
the board of governors and the presidents of the federal 
reserve banks inform discussions of monetary policy among 
policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis 
for policy actions considerable uncertainty attends these 
projections however the economic and statistical models 
and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts 
are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world and 
the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad 
unforeseen developments and events thus in setting the 
stance of monetary policy participants consider not only 
what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied 
in their projections but also the range of alternative 
possibilities the likelihood of their occurring and the potential 
costs to the economy should they occur 
table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a 
range of forecasts including those reported in past monetary 
policy reports and those prepared by the federal reserve 
board’s staff in advance of meetings of the federal open 
market committee fomc the projection error ranges 
shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated 
with economic forecasts for example suppose a 
participant projects that real gross domestic product gdp 
and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of 
respectively 3 percent and 2 percent if the uncertainty attending 
those projections is similar to that experienced in the 
past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced 
the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability 
of about 70 percent that actual gdp would expand 
within a range of 16 to 44 percent in the current year and 
11 to 49 percent in the second and third years the corresponding 
70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation 
would be 11 to 29 percent in the current year 10 to 
30 percent in the second year and 09 to 31 percent in the 
third year figures 4a through 4c illustrate these confidence 
bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and centered 
on the medians of fomc participants’ projections for 
gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation however 
in some instances the risks around the projections may 
not be symmetric in particular the unemployment rate cannot 
be negative furthermore the risks around a particular 
projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside 
in which case the corresponding fan chart would be 
asymmetrically positioned around the median projection 
because current conditions may differ from those that 
prevailed on average over history participants provide 
judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their 
projections of each economic variable is greater than smaller 
than or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty 
seen in the past 20 years as presented in table 2 and 
reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in 
the top panels of figures 4a through 4c participants’ current 
assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projections 
are summarized in the bottomleft panels of those figures 
participants also provide judgments as to whether the 
risks to their projections are weighted to the upside are 
weighted to the downside or are broadly balanced that is 
while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top 
panels of figures 4a through 4c imply that the risks to participants’ 
projections are balanced participants may judge that 
there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather 
than below their projections these judgments are summarized 
in the lowerright panels of figures 4a through 4c 
as with real activity and inflation the outlook for the 
future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable 
uncertainty this uncertainty arises primarily because each 
participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary 
policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity 
and inflation over time if economic conditions evolve 
in an unexpected manner then assessments of the appropriate 
setting of the federal funds rate would change from that 
point forward the final line in table 2 shows the error ranges 
for forecasts of shortterm interest rates they suggest that 
the historical confidence intervals associated with projections 
of the federal funds rate are quite wide it should be noted 
however that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent 
with the projections for the federal funds rate as these 
projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes 
but rather are projections of participants’ individual assessments 
of appropriate monetary policy and are on an endof
year basis however the forecast errors should provide a 
sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal 
funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic 
variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary 
policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of 
shocks to the economy 
if at some point in the future the confidence interval 
around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero it 
would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart 
shown in figure 5 zero is the bottom of the lowest target 
range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the 
committee in the past this approach to the construction of 
the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention 
it would not have any implications for possible future policy 
decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide 
additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so 
were appropriate in such situations the committee could 
also employ other tools including forward guidance and asset 
purchases to provide additional accommodation 
while figures 4a through 4c provide information on 
the uncertainty around the economic projections figure 1 
provides information on the range of views across fomc 
participants a comparison of figure 1 with figures 4a 
through 4c shows that the dispersion of the projections 
across participants is much smaller than the average forecast 
errors over the past 20 years
